# CNN-Binding-Motif
This project uses convolutional neural networks to find transcription factor binding motifs in DNA.

It uses the PDNN library for the neural network implementation.

The training data includes:
- ChIP-Seq data from the ENCODE project (positive cases)
- Random sequences from the Human Genome Project (negative cases)
